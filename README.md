# type-speed-test

This is a repository that contains the code for a short type speed test 
application. The application was originaly written to serve as a code workshop
on the Master of Science in interaction, technology and design programe at 
Ume√• University. The master branch of this repository is the initial state of
the game and the full-implementation branch is what will be built during the
workshop session.

If you are using a mac, everything you need
to do is to run the following commands in a terminal window:

```
git clone git@github.com:linuslagerhjelm/type-speed-test.git && cd type-speed-test && open -a "Safari" index.html
```
 if not, you can still clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:linuslagerhjelm/type-speed-test.git
```

locate the folder in your file browser and and open the file `index.html` in a browser.

Or you could simply just press the "clone or download button" and then "download as zip"
